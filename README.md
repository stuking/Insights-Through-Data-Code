# Insights-Through-Data-Code
This is the set of notebooks for the course Insights through Data. The data used in examples is all open data (usually the link to the data source is in the notebook), however we have avoided resharing the data files here. Usually the files used are the same as those available, but occasionally we have modified the downloaded file before using it, and those we typically  curate for students when we run the course. If you want to use the materials and run into a problem please get in touch.
